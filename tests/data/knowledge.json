            "beginner": "Position in poker refers to where you are seated relative to the dealer button. The later your position, the more information you have about other players' actions before making your decision.",
            "intermediate": "Position is crucial in poker because it determines how much information you have when making decisions. Players in later positions can make more informed decisions based on the actions of players in earlier positions.",
            "advanced": "Positional advantage in poker is a fundamental concept that affects hand selection, bet sizing, and overall strategy. Players in later positions can exploit their informational advantage through wider ranges and more aggressive play."
