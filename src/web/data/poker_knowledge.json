                "beginner": "Position refers to where you are seated relative to the dealer button. Players in later positions (closer to the button) have an advantage because they act after seeing what earlier positions do. This information advantage allows them to make better decisions and play more hands profitably.",
                "intermediate": "Position is one of the most important concepts in poker. In later positions, you can play a wider range of hands because you'll have more information about your opponents' actions. The button is the most profitable position, while early positions like UTG require tighter play. Always consider your position when deciding whether to play a hand.",
                "advanced": "Positional advantage allows for more complex strategies like floating, check-raising, and thin value betting. Understanding position-based ranges and frequencies is essential for GTO play.

                "beginner": "Pot odds are the ratio of the current pot size to the cost of your call. For example, if the pot is $100 and you need to call $20, your pot odds are 5:1 (or you're getting 5-to-1 on your money). If your odds of winning are better than your pot odds, the call is profitable in the long run.",
                "intermediate": "Pot odds help determine if a call is mathematically profitable. Compare the pot odds to your hand's equity against your opponent's range. If your equity percentage is higher than the percentage of the pot you need to contribute, the call is profitable. For example, if you need to call $25 into a $100 pot, you need at least 20% equity to break even.",

Early positions should open around 15-20% of hands, middle positions 20-25%, and late positions 30-50%. Your calling and 3-betting ranges should also vary by position. Use hand charts to study optimal opening ranges for each position.",

Large bets (70-100% of pot) get called less often but win more when called. Your bet size should match your goal: bet smaller with medium-strength hands, larger with strong hands or bluffs.",
                "intermediate": "Modern poker theory suggests using different bet sizes based on board texture and range advantage. Use smaller bets (30-40%) on wet boards where equities run closer together, and larger bets (60-75%) on dry boards where equities are more polarized. Consider using larger sizes for value bets on the river.",

                "intermediate": "GTO concepts include minimum defense frequency (MDF), balanced betting ranges, and unexploitable play. MDF states that you should defend against a bet frequently enough that your opponent can't profit by betting any two cards. For example, against a pot-sized bet, you should continue with around 33% of your range.",
